I've been brainstorming a hyper-minimalist game which captures the cool feeling of navigating a complex transit system or the way a wizard might have to travel between dimensions to travel long distances, but between integers instead. You start at one integer, and are instructed to travel to the next integer. As a player, you only have two buttons to press, which changes the integer you are currently on. The key game mechanic is that the two buttons cannot correspond to a simple idea like the right button increases the value by one and the left decreases, but instead something much more complicated and not explained to the player. Learning the rules of navigation can bring new surprises as you learn to traverse to harder to find numbers, and it might feel as though you are learning a new language. The game could be named after the two characters on the keyboard that are chosen as the two controls. (i.e. [; , or lk, etc.) Additional ideas that i'm not convinced by yet include making bigger numbers generally harder to get to, choosing some set of numbers (i.e. prime numbers or floats or perfect numbers) as numbers which end the game, making the game a super lightweight app for steam, and making a dlc which adds another third control which would act as a even more complicated and difficult to master way to travel.

Instead of being prompted with a target number, simply displaying the current number and nothing else is even more in the spirit of the game. I think that the ideas that you mentioned for controls are not as complicated as what I had in mind: I am imagining that the player will continually discover new, seemingly arbitrary combinations of button presses to metaphorically "switch from the blue tram to a yellow taxi, to a flight that takes you to a spaceship, which you can pilot from one galaxy to the next through a wormhole." I think the more layers of complication, the better, and buying and booting up the game to try understand how exactly to get to 15 should feel fun. Once the player has played for dozens of hours they should have a better idea of the very complicated rules, but they should also understand that there are some rules that they don't know yet because sometimes a certain series of button presses does something that they don't anticipate. I'm imagining that there would be forums of players discussing the many known rules and theories of what more obtuse rules do.

#The file named prototype.py displays the number. The file named gamerules.py will contain the rules of the game.
#The rules of the game are as follows:
'''
1. The player starts at 1.
2. The player has two buttons to press, which changes the integer the player is currently on.
3. The buttons are "a" and "l".
4. For now, they will increase and decrease the integer by 1.

# This is all of the functionality that I wish to implement right now.
# I will now write the code to implement the rules of the game.
